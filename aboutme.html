      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Cole Hamilton,

 My dream has been here since my early childhood and its to be the most successful person in my family. I remember when my great grandpa was still here and he was a very smart man, by far the most successful person in my family so far. But I am here to change that so the next generations of my family wont have to worry about money.

 I am working toward these goals in many ways. Right now I am a full time Day trading and a full time ecommerce student, with other things like affiliate marketing. Its all about the attention you give to a subject.

 There many values that are most necessary to leading to my success. The biggest one is not getting off track, many people say they dream and have ideas about doing something great but in the end they never cared too much about it. Another big value is paying attention, especially in these markets and stores now in days you can miss a simple necessity that they are selling or you could of missed your buy spot same thing with studying your basically learning from a pro but you could of missed the biggest tip that could of helped you.

 I have many short term goals leading to the end goal. I look at goals like dollars there's four quarters in a dollar, and the four quarters of a goal is a short term goal, the four quarters of a short term goal are plans, and the quarters in plans are ideas. My main short term goal is to make at least 100k by the time I'm 17, then to invest it into calls from stocks to bid them, and then put all of that into affiliate marketing.

 I have many traits and achievements, I am a really hard worker, I always look at the bright side, I'm smart, I always focus, and do my best. I have may achievements through sports, academic ideals, and just life period.</p>
